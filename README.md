            Part 1 Problem  was really  cool😎😎 !!But I somehow missed some key points while solving 2nd Part.So it took me around 35+ Minutes to complete the second part 😛   
- [x] Day 3:-    
            Got solutions for both problems with 30 Minute. 
- [x] Day 4:-    
            I started the challenge after 5 Hours. Was really busy with some university stuff and assignments. But managed to find a simple solution.
